# Dashboard - Swiss Health Study

The Swiss Health Study aims at understanding the health status of the Swiss population at a national scale. In Mai 2017, the *Swiss Federal Council* approved the pilot study.

This project is a part of the IT infrastructure that was set for the pilot study. It consists of the main page on which all participants to the study land on which connects them to the different forms of the study.

The goal of this dashboard are the following:
- Motivate the study participants to complete all of the (many) forms of the study, through a reward system.
- Provide a great user experience
- Integrate nicely with the IT infrastructure of the study (REDCap)


The front-end was developed in React, the back-end in PHP. The code can be found in both the `frontend` and `backend` folders.
